# CI/CD Workflows

This document describes the principles and patterns for CI/CD workflows in the workspace template.

## Architecture Overview

The CI/CD architecture is designed around three core principles:

1. **Local reproducibility** - All CI scripts must be runnable locally
2. **Separation of concerns** - GitHub Actions is just a task runner; logic lives in shell scripts
3. **Reusable patterns** - Abstract complexity into reusable workflows

## Three Workflow Types

| Workflow    | Trigger                          | Purpose                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **CI**      | Every commit                     | Gates and checks that must pass regardless |
| **Release** | Merge to main (after CI success) | Semantic versioning, changelog, git tag    |
| **CD**      | New version (tag push)           | Deploy artifacts                           |

### CI Workflow

Runs on every commit to verify code quality. Example jobs might include:

- Pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting)
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Builds

### Release Workflow

Runs only after successful CI on main branch. Handles:

- Semantic versioning based on commit types
- Changelog generation
- Git tag creation
- GitHub release creation

### CD Workflow

Runs when a new version tag is pushed. Handles deployment operations.

### Artifact Publishing Model (Docker & Helm)

Docker images and Helm charts publish through reusable workflows on two triggers:

| Trigger          | When                       | What happens                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CI** (commit)  | Every push                 | Build & push both image and chart, cached, tagged `<sha6>-<branch>`                                                                     |
| **CD** (release) | `v*.*.*` tag (sem-release) | Re-run the same script with the semver — image gets the version tag (cached, so effectively a re-tag), chart is packaged at the version |

Key properties:

- The logic lives in `./scripts/ci/docker.sh [version]` and
  `./scripts/ci/helm.sh <chart_path> [version]`. An empty version = per-commit CI; a version
  arg = release. The reusable workflows (`⚡reusable-docker.yaml`, `⚡reusable-helm.yaml`)
  pass the version (`${{ github.ref_name }}` on CD).
- Setup uses the shared AtomiCloud actions — `AtomiCloud/actions.setup-docker` for Docker and
  `AtomiCloud/actions.setup-nix` for Helm (Helm runs in `nix develop .#cd`). Do **not** call
  the underlying nscloud/buildx actions directly.
- All Nix jobs (pre-commit, Helm, release) share the same Nix store cache via
  `nscloud-cache-tag-atomi-nix-store-cache`.
- There is **no cap** on the number of images or charts — add a caller job per `image_name`
  / `chart_path`.

### Dev Shells

| Shell        | Used by                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `.#ci`       | CI checks (pre-commit)          |
| `.#cd`       | CD / artifact publishing (Helm) |
| `.#releaser` | Semantic release                |

## The Execution Pattern

```
Setup Nix -> Setup Caches -> nix develop -c ./scripts/ci/script.sh
```

**Why this pattern?**

- GitHub Actions is just a task runner
- Real logic lives in shell scripts
- Shell scripts run in Nix = **local reproducibility**
- You can run CI locally: `nix develop .#ci -c ./scripts/ci/script.sh`

### Example Execution

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v6
- uses: AtomiCloud/actions.setup-nix@v2
- run: nix develop .#ci -c ./scripts/ci/script.sh
```

## Reusable Workflow Conventions

### Naming

- Reusable workflows are named with `⚡` emoji prefix
- Format: `⚡reusable-{purpose}.yaml`
- Examples: `⚡reusable-precommit.yaml`, `⚡reusable-test.yaml`

### Separation of Responsibilities

**Caller workflow is responsible for:**

- Defining the trigger
- Wiring only the inputs the reusable workflow actually needs
- Choosing which reusable workflow to invoke

**Reusable workflow is responsible for:**

- Setup (`AtomiCloud/actions.setup-nix@v2` or `AtomiCloud/actions.setup-docker@v1`)
- Running the shell script from `scripts/ci/`

### Inputs: only when required

Reusable workflows declare an input **only if they use it**. Cache keys no longer depend on
platform/service, so `atomi_platform` / `atomi_service` are **not** required inputs — pre-commit
and release take no inputs, `⚡reusable-docker.yaml` takes `image_name`/`dockerfile`/…, and
`⚡reusable-helm.yaml` takes `chart_path`/`version`.

### Example: Reusable Workflow Structure

```yaml
# .github/workflows/⚡reusable-precommit.yaml
name: Reusable Pre-Commit

on:
  workflow_call:

jobs:
  precommit:
    runs-on:
      - nscloud-ubuntu-22.04-amd64-32x64-with-cache
      - nscloud-cache-size-50gb
      - nscloud-cache-tag-atomi-nix-store-cache
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: AtomiCloud/actions.setup-nix@v2
      - run: nix develop .#ci -c ./scripts/ci/pre-commit.sh
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yaml (caller)
name: CI

on:
  push:

jobs:
  precommit:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/⚡reusable-precommit.yaml
    secrets: inherit
```

## Infrastructure and Caching

### NS-Cloud Runners

Runners with Nix store caching for persistent build artifacts.

### Shared Nix Store Cache

All Nix jobs use a single shared cache tag — **not** per-service — so the whole org reuses one
warm store and saves cache space:

```yaml
nscloud-cache-tag-atomi-nix-store-cache
```

## Local Reproducibility

All CI scripts MUST be runnable locally:

```bash
nix develop .#ci -c ./scripts/ci/script.sh
```

This allows developers to:

- Debug CI failures locally
- Run checks without pushing
- Verify changes before committing
